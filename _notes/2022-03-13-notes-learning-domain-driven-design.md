## Part 1: Strategic Design

### 1. Analyzing Business Domains

- Subdomain: a fine-grained area of business activity. All of a
  companies subdomains form its business domain.
- Three types of subdomains:
  1. Core - What a company does differently from its competitors
  2. Generic
  3. Supporting

- Core subdomains are naturally complex and provide a competitive advantage.
- Generic subdomains are also complex but involve activities that all
  companies are performing in the same way. Examples include user
  authentication.
- Supporting subdomains support the company's business, but don't
  provide any competitive advantage.
- Whether a domain could be its own business is a good question to ask
  when identifying core subdomains.
