## Part 1.

### Chapter 1 - A Little Simple Math

- A ⇒ B is the same as the same as (A ∧ B) ∨ (¬B) — I think
- A ⇒ B is true iff A is False or B is True, or both
- in Algebra we have the operators +-*/. Likewise in *propositional logic* we have the operators ⇒∨∧¬≡. And we only have the values True and False
- Predicate logic makes *asserstions* about sets
- ∀ x ∈ S:F ≡ Bounded
  ∀ x:F ≡ Unbounded
- *Universal quantification* generalizes conjunction while
  *existential quatification* generalizes disjunction, i.e. ∀ is
  conjuction and ∃ is disjunction p. 13
- "2*x>x" is a formula. It may be true or false.
  "2*x>x is true" is a statement, i.e. an assertion
