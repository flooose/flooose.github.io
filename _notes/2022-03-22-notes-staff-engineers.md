- We don't involve our tech lead in "roadmap shuffles". Would this be
  different if our team were more roadmap oriented?
- I'll be interested to see if this covers freelancers, or what
  freelancers can gain from this.
- It seems like the "tech-lead" archetype and "solver" archetype would
  be my best approach to a staff developer position p. 18
- Migrating from senior engineer to staff-level involves doing the
  same things that made you successful as a senior, but the senior
  tasks become auxiliary, yielding to becoming "glue", including
  mentorship, exploration and setting technical direction. p. 20
- "It can be helpful to think of the role as being part-time product
  manager for technology" p. 21
